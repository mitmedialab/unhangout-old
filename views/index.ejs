<h1>About</h1>
<p><strong>Unhangout</strong> is an open source platform for running large scale online un-conference-style events using Google Hangouts to create many simultaneous small sessions. Think of it like a classroom with infinitely many breakout rooms. We provide a text-based chat experience that can support hundreds of participants chatting or watching a live video stream together. When you want to create more opportunity for participation, you can break out into up-to-ten person Google Hangout sessions that create opportunities for peer learning instead of just top-down information transfer that is typical in large scale online education.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p><strong>Unhangout</strong> is an open source project. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/drewww/unhangout">our repository on GitHub</a>. Please let us know if you're interested in hosting your own unhangout events - we would be happy to help you get this set up on your own servers. In some situations, we might be able to host your event on our installation, too.<p>

<h3>The Team</h3>

                    Throughout July, NWP partnered with
                    Connected Learning TV to host a webinar
                    series called <a href=

                    style="font-style: italic">Writers at Work:
                    Making and Connected Learning.</a> As a
                    wrap-up to our series we invite you to
                    regroup here to debrief with us, test and
                    tinker with this new unHangout tool, and
                    continue the great conversations that have
                    been started! We will start with a whole
                    group kick-off and then split up into
                    smaller group discussions, based on themes
                    and topics raised by the seminar series.
                    Please be aware that this is a “beta-test
                    webinar” so your adventurous spirit is
                    welcome.

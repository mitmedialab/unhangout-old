        <h3>About</h3>

        <p><strong>Unhangout</strong> is an open source
        platform for running large scale online un-conferences.
        We use Google Hangouts to create as many small sessions
        as needed, and help users find others with shared
        interests.</p>

        <p>Think of it as a classroom with an infinite
        number of breakout sessions. Each event has a landing
        page, which we call the lobby. When participants
        arrive, they can see who else is there and chat with
        each other. The hosts can do a video welcome and
        introduction that gets streamed into the lobby.
        Participants then break out into smaller sessions (up
        to 10 people per session) for in-depth conversations,
        peer-to-peer learning, and collaboration on projects.
        UnHangouts are community-based learning instead of
        top-down information transfer.</p>

        <h3>Open Source</h3>

        <p><strong>Unhangout</strong> is an open source
        project. You can find the code in <a href=
        "https://github.com/drewww/unhangout">our repository on
        GitHub</a>. Please let us know if you're interested in
        hosting your own unhangout events - we would be happy
        to help you get this set up on your own servers. In
        some situations, we might be able to host your event on
        our installation, too.</p>
